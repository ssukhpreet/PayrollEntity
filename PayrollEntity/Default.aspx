                The word “Employer” can refer to two different scenarios. First, it can refer to a company in a database that processes its own payroll and issues its own payroll reports to tax entities and other parties. Some companies who have multiple entities for which to process payroll set up multiple companies for a single employer, though it is much more common for each company to be a separate employer.

               Earnings tell the system the different types of earnings codes you have available for all employees, whether it’s hourly, salaried, piece work, bonus pay, overtime, etc. Deductions/benefits codes define the benefits your company offers and other deductions for things like child support, insurance, etc. and how they are calculated, which will be used to calculate them for each employee.

After setting up the employer within the payroll system, you are ready to begin adding employees, along with each employee’s personal information, which includes social security number, name and address information, and of course any optional information your company chooses to track for each employee. You will then choose pay information, and define how each employee will be paid, such as weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc. Tax information and workers’ compensation class codes are chosen, specific to each employee. Finally, the employee is set up for the method that will be used to pay them, whether it’s direct deposit, a printed check, pay card, or a combination of all three.  </h4>
